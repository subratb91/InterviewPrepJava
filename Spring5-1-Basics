Spring Framework is an open source Java application development framework which supports developing all types of Java applications such as enterprise applications, web applications, cloud based applications and many more.

Java applications developed using Spring are simple, easily testable, reusable and maintainable.

Spring modules does not have tight coupling on each other, developer can pick and choose the modules as per the need for building an enterprise application.
------------------------------------------------------

Spring Framework 5.x has the following key module groups:

Core Container: These are core modules which provide key features of Spring framework

Data Access/Integration: These modules support JDBC and ORM data access approaches in Spring applications .

Web: These modules provide support to implement web applications

Others: Spring also provides few other modules such as test for testing Spring applications
------------------------------------------------------

Core container has following modules:
Core: This is the key module of Spring Framework which provides fundamental support on which all other modules of framework are dependent.

Bean: This module provide basic Spring container called BeanFactory. 

Context: This module provides one more Spring container called ApplicationContext which inherits the basic features of BeanFactory container and also provides additional features to support enterprise application development. 

------------------------------------------------------

Spring Features:


Light Weight
--------------

Spring JARs are relatively small

A basic Spring framework would be lesser than 10MB

Can be deployed in Tomcat and they do not require heavy-weight application servers

Non-Invasive
--------------

Application are developed using POJOs

No need to extend /implement any pre-defined classes

Loosely Coupled
--------------

Spring features like Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming help in loosely coupled code.

Inversion of Control(IoC)
-------------------------

IoC takes care of application objects life cycle along with their dependencies 

Spring Container
--------------

Spring Container takes care of object creation, initialization and managing object dependencies.

Aspect Oriented programming(AOP)
------------------------------

Promotes separation of supporting functions(concerns) such as logging, transaction and security from the core business logic of the application.
